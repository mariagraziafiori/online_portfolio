            <h2>Hi there,</h2>
            <p>my name is <b>Maria Grazia</b>. I was born and raised in Italy and have been living in Switzerland for over 10 years. I currently reside in Zurich, where I work as an Online Channel Manager at ZÃ¼rich Tourism.</p>
            <p>I consider myself a digital enthusiast, since I like staying up-to-date with digital technology developments. In a continually growing digital landscape, I am most interested in <b>web development, UX design, and SEO</b>. I firmly believe these disciplines are interdependent and cannot stand on their own. For this reason, I am constantly looking for a balanced and user-centered approach.</p>
            <p>I am known for my commitment, flexibility, and attention to detail. When I am not working, I like going outside for long walks, appreciating what nature has to offer. I also like listening to music and watching films/documentaries. My favorites include sci-fi, fantasy, adventure, and thrillers.</p>
